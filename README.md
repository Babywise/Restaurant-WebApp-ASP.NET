The API is responsible for communication between the customer app and the restaurant app. The above documentation tells you about routing, responses, descriptions of each route and more.
# Restaurant App
The restaurant app presents an interface to interact with the API to perform inventory management tasks. This app is also responsible for presenting an interface for order management.
# Customer App
The customer app is responsible for presenting an interface for which a user can view the menu and make order requests to the restuarant. Communication is done through the API
